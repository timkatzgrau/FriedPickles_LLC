            <h2></h2>

            <p>Fried Pickles LLC ("we," "us," or "our") operates the NA Beer Finder mobile application (the "App") and associated services, including this website. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you use our App or visit this website.</p>

            <h3>1. Information We Collect</h3>
            <p>We may collect the following types of information:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Personal Information:</strong> Your email address when you subscribe to premium features or use the web sign-in feature via the App. We also assign or retrieve a unique user ID associated with your account.</li>
              <li><strong>Subscription Information:</strong> Details about your subscription status (premium or free), the platform you subscribed through (iOS App Store, Google Play Store, or Web/Stripe), subscription start/expiry dates, cancellation dates, and identifiers provided by payment processors (RevenueCat User ID, Stripe Customer ID).</li>
              <li><strong>Explicit Location Information (App):</strong> With your explicit permission within the App, we collect your device's precise location when you use location-dependent features within the App's web view. This information is passed to the embedded website to provide relevant results (e.g., finding nearby locations). You can disable location services permissions for the App at any time through your device settings.</li>
              <li><strong>App Usage Information:</strong> Information about how you interact with the native parts of the App, such as which tabs you use, interactions with settings, and interactions with the paywall or directory menu.</li>
              <li><strong>Website & Analytics Information:</strong> When you visit this website (including when accessed via the App's WebView), we use Google Analytics to collect information automatically. This may include your IP address, general geographic location derived from your IP address, browser type, operating system, device information, pages you visit, the time and duration of your visits, and referring websites.</li>
              <li><strong>Device Information (App):</strong> We may indirectly collect information about your mobile device, such as the operating system (iOS/Android), primarily to determine the subscription platform and manage app functionality.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>2. How We Use Your Information</h3>
            <p>We use the information we collect for various purposes, including:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>To provide, operate, and maintain the App, website, and their features.</li>
              <li>To process and manage your subscription, including granting premium access.</li>
              <li>To synchronize your account and subscription status across platforms (mobile and web).</li>
              <li>To provide location-based services requested by you within the App's web view.</li>
              <li>To facilitate user authentication via the App, including the web sign-in process using email codes.</li>
              <li>To communicate with you, such as sending verification codes or responding to support requests.</li>
              <li>To analyze website traffic and user behavior using Google Analytics to understand how our services are used, monitor performance, and improve the user experience of both the App and website.</li>
              <li>To fulfill legal obligations.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>3. How We Share Your Information</h3>
            <p>We do not sell your personal information. We may share your information in the following circumstances:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>With Service Providers:</strong> We share information with third-party service providers who perform services on our behalf, such as:
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>RevenueCat:</strong> To process mobile subscriptions, manage entitlements, and synchronize subscription status. (See <a href="https://www.revenuecat.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">RevenueCat's Privacy Policy</a>)</li>
                  <li><strong>Stripe:</strong> To process web subscriptions. Stripe handles your payment card information directly. (See <a href="https://stripe.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stripe's Privacy Policy</a>)</li>
                  <li><strong>Cloudflare:</strong> To host our backend services and database (KV store) where user account and subscription data are stored. (See <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/privacypolicy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cloudflare's Privacy Policy</a>)</li>
                  <li><strong>Google Analytics:</strong> To analyze website usage. Google collects and processes data as described in their privacy policy. (See below for more details).</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li><strong>With the Embedded Website (within the App):</strong> Explicit location data (with your permission) and authentication tokens (user ID, subscription status) are shared with the embedded website (`beerfordriving.com` or its development equivalents) to enable its functionality within the App context. The website operates under this privacy policy regarding data it collects directly.</li>
              <li><strong>For Legal Reasons:</strong> We may disclose your information if required by law, subpoena, or other legal process, or if we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request.</li>
            </ul>
            <SECURITY_REVIEW> Sharing data with Google Analytics is standard practice for website analytics. The data shared (IP, browser, OS, usage patterns, general location) is pseudonymous but can potentially be combined with other data by Google. Users should be aware of this through the policy. Explicit location data shared with the webview relies on app permissions and HTTPS. Other points from the previous review still stand (reliance on third-party security, backend security for user data, etc.). The updated policy clearly outlines the types of location data (explicit vs. inferred from IP) and the use of Google Analytics. </SECURITY_REVIEW>

            <h3>4. Data Storage and Security</h3>
            <p>We use reasonable administrative, technical, and physical security measures to help protect your personal information. Your user ID, email (if provided), and subscription platform may be stored locally on your device using AsyncStorage within the App. User account details and subscription information are stored securely on backend infrastructure provided by Cloudflare. Analytics data is processed and stored by Google. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your Personal Information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>

            <h3>5. Your Choices and Rights</h3>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Location Services (App):</strong> You can enable or disable explicit location service permissions for the App at any time through your device settings.</li>
              <li><strong>Subscription Management:</strong> You can manage your mobile subscription through the App Store (iOS) or Google Play Store (Android). Web subscriptions can be managed via Stripe (link provided within the App/website).</li>
              <li><strong>Google Analytics Opt-Out:</strong> You can opt-out of having your activity on the website made available to Google Analytics by installing the Google Analytics opt-out browser add-on. For more information on the privacy practices of Google, please visit the <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Privacy & Terms web page</a>.</li>
              <li><strong>Access, Correction, Deletion:</strong> You may have the right to access, correct, or request deletion of your personal information held by us (excluding data held solely by third-party services like Google Analytics, RevenueCat, or Stripe, which are subject to their policies). Please contact us using the details below to make such requests. We may need to verify your identity before processing your request. Note that deleting your account may result in the loss of access to premium features.</li>
              <li><strong>Email Communications:</strong> You can opt-out of non-essential email communications (if any) by following the unsubscribe instructions in those emails. Transactional emails (e.g., verification codes) are necessary for certain functions.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>6. Third-Party Services & Analytics</h3>
            <p>The App and website use third-party services for payments, backend infrastructure, and analytics. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of these third parties:</p>

            </ul>
            <p>This website uses Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google, Inc. ("Google").

By using this website, you consent to the processing of data about you by Google in the manner and for the purposes set out above.</p>

            <h3>7. Children's Privacy</h3>
            <p>The App is not intended for use by children under the age of 13 (or relevant age in your jurisdiction). We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If you believe we have inadvertently collected such information, please contact us so we can promptly obtain parental consent or remove the information.</p>

            <h3>8. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h3>
            <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Effective Date" at the top. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.</p>
