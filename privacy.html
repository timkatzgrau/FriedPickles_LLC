          <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>

          <p>Fried Pickles LLC ("we," "us," or "our") operates the NA Beer Finder mobile application (the "App") and associated services, including this website. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you use our App or visit this website.</p>

          <h3>1. Information We Collect</h3>
          <p>We may collect the following types of information:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Personal Information:</strong> Your email address when you subscribe to premium features or use the web sign-in feature via the App. We also assign or retrieve a unique user ID associated with your account.</li>

            <li><strong>Subscription Information:</strong> Details about your subscription status (premium or free), the platform you subscribed through (iOS App Store, Google Play Store, or Web/Stripe), subscription start/expiry dates, cancellation dates, and identifiers provided by payment processors (RevenueCat User ID, Stripe Customer ID).</li>

            <li>
              <strong>Location Information (App):</strong> We collect two types of location data:
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Explicit Location for Venue Search:</strong> With your explicit permission within the App, we collect your device's precise location when you use location-dependent features within the App's web view to find nearby venues. You can disable location permissions at any time through your device settings.</li>
                <li><strong>Location Tracking (NA Radar - Premium Feature):</strong> If you enable the "Track My Town" feature within NA Radar, you can set a tracked location to receive notifications about new venues and products near that area. We convert your tracked location into a geographic "chunk" (a grid square approximately 7 miles wide) to protect your precise location. This chunk identifier is shared with OneSignal to enable location-based notifications. You can update or remove your tracked location at any time within the NA Radar settings.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>

            <li>
              <strong>Push Notification Data:</strong> We use OneSignal to send push notifications about new products, discounts, and nearby venues. This includes:
              <ul>
                <li>Device push tokens and notification identifiers</li>
                <li>Notification interaction data (opens, dismisses, time viewed)</li>
                <li>Custom user tags including subscription status (isPremium), geographic location chunk for targeted notifications (chunk), and brand tracking preferences</li>
                <li>Device information (OS version, app version, device model)</li>
                <li>User identifier (synced with RevenueCat)</li>
                <li>Email address (when provided)</li>
              </ul>
              <p><strong>Sponsored Notifications:</strong> We partner with non-alcoholic beverage brands to send promotional push notifications. Brands may pay us to deliver targeted notifications about their products, discounts, and new releases to users who have subscribed to those brands in NA Radar or who may be interested based on their app usage. You can unsubscribe from specific brands or disable push notifications entirely at any time through the App's Settings.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <strong>Brand and Product Preferences (Premium Feature):</strong> When you use the NA Radar feature, we collect and store:
              <ul>
                <li>Your selected brand subscriptions</li>
                <li>Product browsing history</li>
                <li>Search queries within the Directory tab</li>
                <li>Cached product and brand data stored locally on your device</li>
              </ul>
            </li>

            <li>
              <strong>Onboarding Preferences:</strong> During first-time setup, we collect:
              <ul>
                <li>Location permission preference</li>
                <li>Push notification permission preference</li>
                <li>NA Radar feature opt-in preference</li>
                <li>App launch count (to determine when to prompt for notifications)</li>
              </ul>
            </li>

            <li><strong>App Usage Information:</strong> Information about how you interact with the native parts of the App, such as which tabs you use, interactions with settings, and interactions with the paywall or directory menu.</li>

            <li>
              <strong>Conversion Tracking and App Events:</strong> We use the Meta SDK to track app events and conversions for advertising campaigns we run on Facebook and Instagram. This includes:
              <ul>
                <li>App events and conversions (subscriptions, purchases, feature usage, tab navigation)</li>
                <li>Device information and anonymous user identifiers</li>
                <li>Session data and time spent in app</li>
                <li>Subscription status (premium/free) for conversion tracking</li>
                <li>Brand preferences and NA Radar subscriptions</li>
                <li>Meta Advertising ID (IDFA on iOS, AAID on Android) for conversion attribution</li>
              </ul>
              <p><strong>Important:</strong> We run advertising campaigns on Facebook and Instagram to promote our app and services. The Meta SDK in the app tracks events and conversions to measure the effectiveness of these external advertising campaigns. We do not display ads within the app itself.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <strong>Crash and Error Data:</strong> We use Sentry to collect crash reports and error logs to help us improve app stability. This includes:
              <ul>
                <li>Stack traces and error messages</li>
                <li>Device information (OS version, device model, app version)</li>
                <li>User actions leading to crashes</li>
                <li>Technical diagnostic information</li>
              </ul>
            </li>

            <li><strong>Website & Analytics Information:</strong> When you visit this website (including when accessed via the App's WebView), we use Google Analytics to collect information automatically. This may include your IP address, general geographic location derived from your IP address, browser type, operating system, device information, pages you visit, the time and duration of your visits, and referring websites.</li>

            <li><strong>Device Information (App):</strong> We may indirectly collect information about your mobile device, such as the operating system (iOS/Android), primarily to determine the subscription platform and manage app functionality.</li>
          </ul>

          <h4>1.1 Mobile App Permissions</h4>
          <p>Our mobile app requests the following permissions:</p>
          <p><strong>iOS Permissions:</strong></p>

          <h3>2.1 Advertising and Monetization</h3>
          <p><strong>How We Make Money:</strong> The App is free to download and use, with optional premium features available via subscription. We generate revenue through:</p>

          </ul>
          <p><strong>What This Means for You:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>If you subscribe to a brand in NA Radar, that brand (or we, on their behalf) may send you promotional push notifications about their products.</li>
            <li>We do not display advertisements within the app itself.</li>

            <li>We do not sell your email address or personally identifiable information to third parties.</li>

          <h3>3. How We Share Your Information</h3>
          <p>We do not sell your personal information in the traditional sense. However, sharing data with advertising platforms like Facebook may be considered a "sale" under certain privacy laws (see Section 10 for California residents). We may share your information in the following circumstances:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>With Service Providers:</strong> We share information with third-party service providers who perform services on our behalf, such as:
              <ul>
                <li><strong>RevenueCat:</strong> To process mobile subscriptions, manage entitlements, and synchronize subscription status. (See <a href="https://www.revenuecat.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">RevenueCat's Privacy Policy</a>)</li>
                <li><strong>Stripe:</strong> To process web subscriptions. Stripe handles your payment card information directly. (See <a href="https://stripe.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stripe's Privacy Policy</a>)</li>
                <li><strong>Cloudflare:</strong> To host our backend services and database (KV store) where user account and subscription data are stored. (See <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/privacypolicy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cloudflare's Privacy Policy</a>)</li>
                <li><strong>OneSignal:</strong> To deliver push notifications and manage notification preferences. OneSignal processes device tokens, notification interaction data, and custom tags. (See <a href="https://onesignal.com/privacy_policy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OneSignal's Privacy Policy</a>)</li>
                <li><strong>Sentry:</strong> To monitor app stability and collect crash reports. Sentry processes error logs, stack traces, and device information. (See <a href="https://sentry.io/privacy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sentry's Privacy Policy</a>)</li>
                <li><strong>Facebook (Meta):</strong> To track app usage analytics and understand user behavior. Facebook processes app events, device information, and anonymous identifiers. (See <a href="https://www.facebook.com/privacy/policy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Facebook's Privacy Policy</a>)</li>
                <li><strong>Google Analytics:</strong> To analyze website usage. Google collects and processes data as described in their privacy policy. (See <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Privacy & Terms</a>)</li>
                <li><strong>Google Sheets API:</strong> To fetch up-to-date brand, product, and directory information. We access read-only product data from Google Sheets. No personal information is sent to Google Sheets. (See <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Privacy & Terms</a>)</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>With the Embedded Website (within the App):</strong> Explicit location data (with your permission) and authentication tokens (user ID, subscription status) are shared with the embedded website (`beerfordriving.com` or its development equivalents) to enable its functionality within the App context. The website operates under this privacy policy regarding data it collects directly.</li>
            <li><strong>For Legal Reasons:</strong> We may disclose your information if required by law, subpoena, or other legal process, or if we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>4. Data Storage and Security</h3>
          <p>We use reasonable administrative, technical, and physical security measures to help protect your personal information. Your user ID, email (if provided), and subscription platform may be stored locally on your device using AsyncStorage within the App. Brand preferences and product data are cached locally on your device using AsyncStorage for up to 24 hours to improve performance and enable offline access. User account details and subscription information are stored securely on backend infrastructure provided by Cloudflare. Analytics data is processed and stored by Google. Crash reports are stored by Sentry. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your Personal Information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>

          <ul>
            <li><strong>Location Services (App):</strong> You can enable or disable explicit location service permissions for the App at any time through your device settings.</li>
            <li><strong>Location Tracking (Track My Town):</strong> You can update or remove your tracked location at any time within the NA Radar &gt; Track My Town section. Removing your tracked location will stop location-based notifications.</li>
            <li><strong>Push Notifications:</strong> You can enable or disable push notifications through your device settings or within the App's Settings tab. Disabling push notifications will prevent you from receiving updates about new products and discounts from brands you follow.</li>
            <li><strong>Subscription Management:</strong> You can manage your mobile subscription through the App Store (iOS) or Google Play Store (Android). Web subscriptions can be cancelled within the mobile app by navigating to Settings located at https://beerfordriving.com/settings, or by visiting that URL directly in a web browser. Web subscription management is processed through Stripe's portal.</li>
            <li><strong>Google Analytics Opt-Out:</strong> You can opt-out of having your activity on the website made available to Google Analytics by installing the Google Analytics opt-out browser add-on. For more information on the privacy practices of Google, please visit the <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Privacy & Terms web page</a>.</li>
            <li><strong>Facebook Analytics Opt-Out:</strong> You can limit ad tracking through your device settings (iOS: Settings &gt; Privacy &gt; Tracking; Android: Settings &gt; Google &gt; Ads).</li>
            <li><strong>Crash Reporting:</strong> Crash reports are automatically sent to help us improve app stability. These reports do not contain personally identifiable information beyond technical device details.</li>
            <li><strong>Access, Correction, Deletion:</strong> You may have the right to access, correct, or request deletion of your personal information held by us (excluding data held solely by third-party services like Google Analytics, RevenueCat, or Stripe, which are subject to their policies). Please contact us using the details below to make such requests. We may need to verify your identity before processing your request. Note that deleting your account may result in the loss of access to premium features.</li>
            <li><strong>Email Communications:</strong> You can opt-out of non-essential email communications (if any) by following the unsubscribe instructions in those emails. Transactional emails (e.g., verification codes) are necessary for certain functions.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>6. Third-Party Services & Analytics</h3>

          <p><strong>Do Not Sell My Personal Information:</strong></p>
          <p>While we do not sell personal information in the traditional sense, our use of advertising services may constitute a "sale" under CCPA. Specifically:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Meta Conversion Tracking:</strong> We share app event and conversion data with Meta to measure the effectiveness of our advertising campaigns on Facebook and Instagram. This may be considered a "sale" under CCPA.</li>
            <li><strong>Google Analytics:</strong> We share pseudonymous usage data with Google for analytics purposes.</li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>How to Opt-Out of Data "Sales":</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Meta Tracking:</strong> Limit ad tracking in device settings (iOS: Settings &gt; Privacy &gt; Tracking; Android: Settings &gt; Google &gt; Ads). This will prevent Meta from receiving your advertising ID for conversion tracking.</li>
            <li><strong>Google Analytics:</strong> Use the Google Analytics Opt-Out Browser Add-On (for web usage).</li>
            <li><strong>Push Notifications:</strong> Disable push notifications or unsubscribe from specific brands in the App's Settings to stop receiving sponsored notifications.</li>
            <li><strong>Account Deletion:</strong> Contact us at <a href="mailto:contact@beerfinder.io">contact@beerfinder.io</a> to request full account deletion, which will remove your data from our systems and stop all data sharing with third parties.</li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>Note:</strong> Opting out of tracking will prevent us from measuring conversions from our external advertising campaigns. You may still receive promotional notifications from brands you've subscribed to in NA Radar unless you unsubscribe from those brands or disable push notifications.</p>
