          <h2>Terms and Conditions</h2>

          <p>Welcome to NA Beer Finder! These Terms and Conditions ("Terms") govern your use of the NA Beer Finder mobile application (the "App"), the associated website located at https://beerfordriving.com, and any related services provided by Fried Pickles LLC ("we," "us," or "our").</p>
          <p>By accessing or using the App or Website (collectively, the "Services"), you agree to be bound by these Terms and our Privacy Policy, found at <a href="privacy.html">https://friedpicklesllc.com/privacy.html</a>. If you do not agree to these Terms, please do not use the Services.</p>

          <h3>1. License to Use</h3>
          <p>Subject to your compliance with these Terms, we grant you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, revocable license to:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Download, install, and use the App on a mobile device that you own or control.</li>
            <li>Access and use the Website.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>This license is solely for your personal, non-commercial use.</p>

          <h3>2. Accounts and Subscriptions</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Accounts:</strong> Accessing premium features requires a subscription. Subscribing via the App (using RevenueCat) or the Website (using Stripe) links your subscription status to an identifier (like an email address or user ID). You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of any login information (e.g., for web sign-in codes).</li>
            <li>
              <strong>Subscriptions:</strong> We offer subscription plans ("Premium") that provide access to enhanced features, including the NA Radar feature with personalized brand content and location-based notifications.
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Mobile Subscriptions (iOS/Android):</strong> Managed through RevenueCat and processed via the respective app stores (Apple App Store, Google Play Store). These subscriptions are subject to the terms and conditions of the app stores. Billing, renewals, and cancellations are handled by the app store.</li>
                <li><strong>Web Subscriptions:</strong> Purchased and managed through Stripe on our website (https://beerfordriving.com). By purchasing a web subscription, you agree to Stripe's terms and conditions. Subscriptions typically renew automatically unless cancelled.</li>
                <li><strong>Fees:</strong> Subscription fees are specified at the time of purchase. We reserve the right to change subscription fees upon reasonable notice.</li>
                <li><strong>Cancellation:</strong> You can cancel mobile subscriptions through your App Store or Google Play account settings. Web subscriptions can be cancelled within the mobile app by navigating to Settings and tapping "Cancel Subscription," which directs you to https://beerfordriving.com/settings, or by visiting that URL directly in a web browser. Cancellation is processed through Stripe's management portal. Cancellation typically takes effect at the end of the current billing period. No refunds are generally provided for partial subscription periods.</li>
                <li><strong>Cross-Platform Access:</strong> Web subscribers can access their premium status in the mobile app by signing in with their email address. Mobile app subscriptions (purchased through Apple or Google) are only valid within the mobile app and do not provide premium access on the website.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>3. User Conduct</h3>

          <ul>
            <li>Violate any applicable laws or regulations.</li>
            <li>Infringe upon or violate our intellectual property rights or the intellectual property rights of others.</li>
            <li>Transmit any worms, viruses, or any code of a destructive nature.</li>
            <li>Attempt to gain unauthorized access to our systems or engage in any activity that disrupts, diminishes the quality of, interferes with the performance of, or impairs the functionality of the Services.</li>
            <li>Scrape, copy, or redistribute content from the Services without our express written permission, except as explicitly enabled by the Services' features (e.g., sharing).</li>
            <li>Abuse or spam push notification features.</li>
            <li>Attempt to access or scrape brand/product data from our backend systems or Google Sheets data sources.</li>
            <li>Reverse engineer the App to extract API keys, access tokens, or other sensitive credentials.</li>
            <li>Use the Services for any commercial purpose not expressly permitted by these Terms.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>4. Intellectual Property</h3>
          <p>The Services and their original content (excluding content provided by users, if any), features, and functionality are and will remain the exclusive property of Fried Pickles LLC and its licensors. The Services are protected by copyright, trademark, and other laws of both the United States and foreign countries. Our trademarks and trade dress may not be used in connection with any product or service without our prior written consent.</p>

          <h3>5. Third-Party Services and Links</h3>
          <p>The Services utilize or may link to third-party services and websites, including but not limited to:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>RevenueCat</strong> (Mobile Payments and Subscription Management)</li>
            <li><strong>Stripe</strong> (Web Payments)</li>
            <li><strong>Cloudflare</strong> (Backend Infrastructure and Data Storage)</li>
            <li><strong>OneSignal</strong> (Push Notifications)</li>

            <li><strong>Google Sheets API</strong> (Product and Brand Data)</li>
            <li>Embedded content from <code>beerfordriving.com</code> or similar domains.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>We have no control over, and assume no responsibility for, the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party websites or services. You acknowledge and agree that we shall not be responsible or liable, directly or indirectly, for any damage or loss caused or alleged to be caused by or in connection with the use of or reliance on any such content, goods, or services available on or through any such websites or services.</p>
          <p>We strongly advise you to read the terms and conditions and privacy policies of any third-party websites or services that you visit or use.</p>

          <h3>6. Location Services</h3>
          <p>The App uses location data for two purposes:</p>
          <ol>
            <li><strong>Venue Search:</strong> When you use the map feature (via the embedded website), we request your device's precise location to find nearby venues offering non-alcoholic beverages. This is handled with your explicit permission each time you use the feature.</li>
            <li><strong>Location Tracking (NA Radar - Premium Feature):</strong> If you opt into the "Track My Town" feature within NA Radar, you can set a tracked location to receive notifications about new venues and products near that area. We convert your location into a geographic grid square (chunk) to protect your precise location. You can update or remove your tracked location at any time within the App's NA Radar settings.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>By enabling location permissions for the App, you consent to our collection and use of location data as described in our Privacy Policy to provide these features. You may disable location permissions at any time through your device settings, though this will limit the functionality of location-based features.</p>

          <h3>7. Push Notifications and Sponsored Content</h3>
          <p>If you enable push notifications, we may send you notifications about:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>New products and releases from brands you've subscribed to in NA Radar</li>
            <li>Discounts and special offers from your favorite brands</li>
            <li>New venues near your tracked location (if you've enabled the "Track My Town" feature)</li>
            <li>App updates and new features</li>
            <li><strong>Sponsored promotional content from brands that pay us to reach relevant users</strong></li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>Sponsored Notifications:</strong> By subscribing to brands in NA Radar or enabling push notifications, you acknowledge and agree that:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Non-alcoholic beverage brands may pay us to send promotional push notifications to you about their products, discounts, and new releases.</li>
            <li>We will target these sponsored notifications based on your brand subscriptions, app usage, and preferences to ensure relevance.</li>
            <li>You can unsubscribe from specific brands or disable push notifications entirely at any time through the App's Settings tab or your device settings.</li>
            <li>Sponsored notifications will be clearly identifiable and relevant to your interests in non-alcoholic beverages.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>You can disable push notifications at any time through your device settings or within the App's Settings tab. We use OneSignal to deliver push notifications, and by opting in, you agree that your device information and notification preferences will be processed by OneSignal in accordance with their privacy policy.</p>

          <h3>7.1 Data Tracking for External Advertising</h3>
          <p>We run advertising campaigns on Facebook and Instagram to promote our Services. By using the Services, you acknowledge and agree that:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>No In-App Ads:</strong> We do not display advertisements within the App itself.</li>
            <li><strong>Conversion and Event Tracking:</strong> We use the Meta SDK to track app conversions and events (such as subscriptions, purchases, and app usage patterns) to measure the effectiveness of our external advertising campaigns on Facebook and Instagram.</li>
            <li><strong>Data Sharing:</strong> Your app events and conversion data may be shared with Meta for the purpose of measuring advertising effectiveness and optimizing our external ad campaigns. This data sharing helps us provide the App for free and improve our marketing efforts.</li>
            <li><strong>Opt-Out:</strong> You can limit ad tracking through your device settings (iOS: Settings &gt; Privacy &gt; Tracking; Android: Settings &gt; Google &gt; Ads).</li>
            <li><strong>Revenue Model:</strong> We generate revenue through subscriptions and brand partnerships. This allows us to offer the App for free with optional premium features.</li>
          </ul>
