            <p>Welcome to NA Beer Finder! These Terms and Conditions ("Terms") govern your use of the NA Beer Finder mobile application (the "App"), the associated website located at https://beerfordriving.com, and any related services provided by Fried Pickles LLC ("we," "us," or "our").</p>
            <p>By accessing or using the App or Website (collectively, the "Services"), you agree to be bound by these Terms and our Privacy Policy, found at <a href="privacy.html">https://friedpicklesllc.com/privacy.html</a>. If you do not agree to these Terms, please do not use the Services.</p>

            <h3>1. License to Use</h3>
            <p>Subject to your compliance with these Terms, we grant you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, revocable license to:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Download, install, and use the App on a mobile device that you own or control.</li>
              <li>Access and use the Website.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This license is solely for your personal, non-commercial use.</p>

            <h3>2. Accounts and Subscriptions</h3>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Accounts:</strong> Accessing premium features requires a subscription. While a formal user account creation process may not exist on the website itself, subscribing via the App (using RevenueCat) or the Website (using Stripe) links your subscription status to an identifier (like an email address or user ID). You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of any login information (e.g., for web sign-in codes).</li>
              <li>
                <strong>Subscriptions:</strong> We offer subscription plans ("Premium") that provide access to enhanced features.
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Mobile Subscriptions (iOS/Android):</strong> Managed through RevenueCat and processed via the respective app stores (Apple App Store, Google Play Store). These subscriptions are subject to the terms and conditions of the app stores. Billing, renewals, and cancellations are handled by the app store.</li>
                  <li><strong>Web Subscriptions:</strong> Managed and processed through Stripe. By purchasing a web subscription, you agree to Stripe's terms and conditions. Subscriptions typically renew automatically unless cancelled.</li>
                  <li><strong>Fees:</strong> Subscription fees are specified at the time of purchase. We reserve the right to change subscription fees upon reasonable notice.</li>
                  <li><strong>Cancellation:</strong> You can cancel mobile subscriptions through your App Store or Google Play account settings. Web subscriptions can be managed via the link provided in the App/Website, which directs you to Stripe's management portal. Cancellation typically takes effect at the end of the current billing period. No refunds are generally provided for partial subscription periods.</li>
                  <li><strong>Cross-Platform Access:</strong> We facilitate accessing your premium status across platforms using your email address or a unique identifier stored in our system.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>3. User Conduct</h3>
            <p>You agree not to use the Services to:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Violate any applicable laws or regulations.</li>
              <li>Infringe upon or violate our intellectual property rights or the intellectual property rights of others.</li>
              <li>Transmit any worms, viruses, or any code of a destructive nature.</li>
              <li>Attempt to gain unauthorized access to our systems or engage in any activity that disrupts, diminishes the quality of, interferes with the performance of, or impairs the functionality of the Services.</li>
